dialogue summarization task using generative AI.

how different input texts influence the model's output and practice prompt engineering to tailor it to specific needs. 

comparing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences, is a 1st step into prompt engineering and discover how it can improve the generative output of Large Language Models.
